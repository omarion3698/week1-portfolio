      <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello</p>
        <p>I am Omar Abdirahman. I was a student some few years back and am still a student learning a Technical University of Kenya doing the Bachelor of Science in Aeronautical Engineering first year.</p>
        <p>I took my Secondary school at Don Bosco Secondary School and Al Mohajiroon Primary School for primary school.</p>
        <p>I don't have any job experience so far. I chose Moringa School to build a computer skill that can solve day-to-day problems.</p>
    <p>Aiming to Develop.<br>I can and I will!</p>
